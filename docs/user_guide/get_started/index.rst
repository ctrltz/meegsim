Getting started with MEEGsim
============================

Welcome to MEEGsim! In this overview tutorial, you will learn how to simulate an
M/EEG dataset using building blocks provided by our toolbox. In particular, we will
cover the following aspects:

* prerequisites for the simulation and general workflow
* different types of sources and how to add them to the simulation
* how to set up location and waveform of a source
* how to adjust the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and/or standard deviation of activity for added sources
* how to set up phase coupling between waveforms of different sources
* how to obtain sensor-space data for the simulated source configuration
