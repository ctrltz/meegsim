Getting started with MEEGsim
============================

Welcome to MEEGsim! In this overview, you will learn how to simulate an M/EEG dataset
with our toolbox. In particular, we will cover the following aspects:

* prerequisites for the simulation and general workflow
* different types of sources and how to add them to the simulation
* how to set up location and waveform of any source
* how to adjust the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of added sources
* how to set up phase coupling between waveforms of source activity
