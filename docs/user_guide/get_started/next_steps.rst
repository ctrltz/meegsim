That was it for the general introduction to MEEGsim! Follow the links from the list
below to learn more about the functionality of the package:

 * :doc:`Advanced topics </user_guide/advanced/index>`: visit this page to learn more
   about features that were left of the introductory tutorial: patch sources, local
   adjustment of SNR, etc.

 * :doc:`Examples <../../auto_examples/index>`: here you can find various examples
   that illustrate the nuances of built-in components
   (e.g., :doc:`coupling parameters <../../auto_examples/building_blocks/plot_coupling>`)
   or provide a :doc:`backbone <../../auto_examples/basics/plot_minimal_example>`
   for your own simulations.

 * Obviously, the toolbox does not cover the needs of every possible simulation.
   Visit the :doc:`Customization </user_guide/advanced/customization>` page to learn how to extend
   the provided functionality to fit your use case, or how to integrate input from
   other packages providing methods for simulating data, such as
   `NeuroDSP <https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/>`_.

 * If you ran into problems while trying to use our package, feel free to describe your
   problem in a `new discussion <https://github.com/ctrltz/meegsim/discussions/new?category=q-a>`_ on GitHub.

 * Found a bug? Have an idea for a new feature? Feel free to create an issue
   `here <https://github.com/ctrltz/meegsim/issues/new>`_.
