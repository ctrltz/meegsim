Install
=======

Use the following command to install meegsim:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install meegsim[plot]

By including the ``[plot]`` part, you make sure that the dependencies required
for plotting are also installed. If plotting is not needed, the command below
would lead to a more light-weight installation with all core features intact:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install meegsim
