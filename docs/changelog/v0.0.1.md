# Version 0.0.1 - Unreleased

## Added

- SourceSimulator class that allows adding point and patch sources with custom locations and waveforms to the simulation
- Template waveforms of white noise, narrowband oscillation (white noise filtered in a narrow frequency band) and 1/f noise with adjustable slope
- Random vertices in the whole source space or in a subset of vertices as location for point sources
- Adjustment of the SNR of the sources based on sensor space power
- Phase-phase coupling with a constant phase lag or a probabilistic phase lag according to the von Mises distribution
- Traversal of the coupling graph to ensure that the coupling is set up correctly when multiple connectivity edges are defined
