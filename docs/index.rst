Welcome to meegsim's documentation!
===================================

**MEEGsim** is a Python package that provides template waveforms for 
simulating M/EEG data with known ground truth source activity. In
addition, it aims to simplify the manipulation of relevant simulation 
parameters (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio and source connectivity). As a
result, the users can focus on `what` to simulate, not on `how` to implement
the simulation. The package is designed to be compatible with MNE-Python 
and re-uses the forward and inverse modeling functionality provided by MNE.
