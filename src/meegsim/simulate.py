        ----------
        location: list or callable
            Locations of sources can be either specified directly as a list of tuples
            (index of the src, vertno) or as a function that returns such a list.
            In the first case, source locations will be the same for every configuration,
            while in the second configurations might differ (e.g., if the function 
            returns a random location).
        waveform: np.array or callable
            Q: should we allow passing an array directly?
            Q: don't set a default waveform here to make user explicitly choose it? or just generate alpha by default?
        snr: None (do not adjust SNR), float (same SNR for all sources), or array (one value per source)
            TODO: fix when finalizing SNR
            NB: only positive values make sense, raise error if negative ones are provided
        location_params: dict, optional
            Keyword arguments that will be passed to the location function.
        waveform_params: dict, optional
            Keyword arguments that will be passed to the waveform function.
        snr_params: dict, optional
            TODO: fix when finalizing SNR
            fmin and fmax for the frequency band that will be used to adjust SNR.
        names: list, optional
            A list of names for each source. If not specified, the names will be
            autogenerated using the format 'sgN-sM', where N is the index of the

            Waveform provided either directly as an array or as a function.
