        ----------
        location: list or callable
            Locations of sources can be either specified directly as a list of tuples
            (index of the src, vertno) or as a function that returns such a list.
            In the first case, source locations will be the same for every configuration,
            while in the second configurations might differ (e.g., if the function 
            returns a random location).
        waveform: np.array or callable
            Waveforms of source activity provided either directly in an array (fixed
            for every configuration) or as a function that generates the waveforms
            (but differ between configurations if the generation is random). 
        snr: None, float, or array
            SNR values for the defined sources. Can be None (no adjustment of SNR),
            a single value that is used for all sources or an array with one SNR
            value per source.
        location_params: dict, optional
            Keyword arguments that will be passed to the location function.
        waveform_params: dict, optional
            Keyword arguments that will be passed to the waveform function.
        snr_params: dict, optional
            Additional parameters required for the adjustment of SNR.
            Specify fmin and fmax here to define the frequency band which 
            should used for calculating the SNR.
        names: list, optional
            A list of names for each source. If not specified, the names will be
            autogenerated using the format 'sgN-sM', where N is the index of the
